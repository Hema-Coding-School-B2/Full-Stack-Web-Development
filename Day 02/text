Web development is a crucial skill in the modern digital age. It involves creating websites and applications for the internet.


HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is used to create the structure of web pages.


 HTML provides several tags to format text. For instance, text can be
      underlined for emphasis or hyperlinks. In chemical formulas, subscript
      text such as H2O is used to represent water. Conversely, superscript text
      like x2 is common in mathematical expressions. To highlight important
      words, you can use bold text to make them stand out. Finally, inserting a
      line break without starting a new paragraph is possible, allowing text to
      continue on a new line. This is an example of a new line using a line
      break.
