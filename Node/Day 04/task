1. Create a Readable Stream
Objective: Implement a readable stream that emits data at intervals.

Instructions:
Use Node's stream.Readable class to create a custom readable stream.
The stream should emit data (a random number) every second.
After emitting five data chunks, the stream should end.


2. Implement a Duplex Stream
Objective: Create a duplex stream that echoes back data in uppercase.

Instructions:
Use Node’s stream.Duplex class to create a custom duplex stream.
For each chunk of data written, convert it to uppercase and push it back.
Test it by writing and reading data.


3.  Create a Transform Stream
Objective: Create a transform stream that reverses each data chunk.

Instructions:
Use Node’s stream.Transform class to create a custom transform stream.
For each incoming chunk, reverse its content and pass it to the readable side.
Test the stream by writing data and reading the transformed output.
